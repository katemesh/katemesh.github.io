|<img class="side-picture-square" src="/Images/CHAT_NEG1.jpg">|Since 2012, Iâ€™ve investigated how people in one indigenous Chatino community talk about the world around them. Hearing people in the community blend visual and auditory language to create complex *multimodal* messages, while deaf people in the community shift the system so that equally rich messages can be expressed in a fully visual system. My research documents the strategies that hearing and deaf Chatinos share, and highlights areas where their linguistic systems diverge. <br><br>Representative Publication: Mesh, K. & Hou, L.
