Since 2012, Iâ€™ve investigated how people San Juan Quiahije, an indigenous Chatino community in Oaxaca, Mexico, use their bodies to convey linguistic information.

I investigate how these messages are formed on the move, during navigational activities. My current projects focus on how demonstrative expressions (the rough equivalents of English 'this' and 'that') and direction terms are paired with pointing gestures. |

My work documents the strategies that hearing and deaf Chatinos share, and highlights areas where deaf people are creating new linguistic structures. |
