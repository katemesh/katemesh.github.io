|<img class="side-picture-square" src="/Images/CHAT_NEG1.jpg">|Since 2012, I’ve worked with UT Austin’s [Chatino Language Documentation Project](https://sites.google.com/site/lenguachatino/) to investigate how hearing and deaf people in one indigenous Chatino community of Mexico use gestures of the hands and body to communicate. My research documents the larger community's conventions for using gesture, and shows how  signers are shifting these conventions as they create their emerging language. <br><br>Representative Manuscript: Mesh, K. & Hou, L.
