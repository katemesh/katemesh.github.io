## About Me

I study how hearing people gesture while they speak, and how deaf people 
adapt many of these gestures for use as signs in emerging signed languages (young 
signed languages that are just now being created).


Since 2012, I’ve worked with of UT Austin’s [Chatino Language Documentation Project (CLDP)](https://sites.google.com/site/lenguachatino/)
 to investigate how hearing and deaf people in one indigenous Chatino community use gestures of the hands and body to
 communicate. 
 
 Currently I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Haifa, studying the relationship of gesture 
 and signed language as a member of the [Grammar of the Body](http://gramby.haifa.ac.il)
research group.
