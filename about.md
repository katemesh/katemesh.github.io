I study how hearing people gesture while they speak, and how deaf people 
adapt many of these gestures for use as signs in young signed languages that are just now being created. 
My research is fieldwork-based and typological, comparing how gesturers and signers across cultures recruit 
the body for meaning-making, and focusing in particular on how people use the body to draw attention to their 
real-world surroundings. 

Since 2012, I’ve worked with of UT Austin’s [Chatino Language Documentation Project (CLDP)](https://sites.google.com/site/lenguachatino/)
 to investigate how hearing and deaf people in one indigenous Chatino community use gestures of the hands and body to
 communicate. For my dissertation research, I documented the strategies hearing community members use when directing
  attention to items in the space around them, including the use of spoken language expressions like demonstratives and 
  uphill-downhill terms, as well as gestural behaviors like pointing with the hands and lips.  After describing 
  the conventions of speakers, I made a direct comparison with the strategies of signers in the same community, showing how
   signers have altered and elaborated the community’s pointing conventions to integrate them into their emerging language. 
 
 Currently I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Haifa, researching gesture 
 and signed language as a member of Wendy Sandler's [Grammar of the Body](http://gramby.haifa.ac.il)
research group. I lead a project comparing the communicative strategies of Hebrew speakers and
 Israeli Sign Language (ISL) users. The project investigates how speakers and signers use gaze and manual pointing 
 with two functions: (i) to direct attention to items in the real space around them (locating), and (ii) to 
 maintain focus on characters who are introduced and described in complex narratives (reference tracking). 
  Early findings from the project reveal that speakers and signers alike use gaze direction to distinguish
   locating points from reference tracking ones; an extension of the study considers how signers may
 strengthen this pattern as they integrate pointing into the language-specific constructions of ISL.
